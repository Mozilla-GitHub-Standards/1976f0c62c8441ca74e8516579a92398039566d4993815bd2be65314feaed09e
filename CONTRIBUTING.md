## Contributing!

* Familarize yourself with [Heartbeat](https://heartbeat.mozilla.community/), which acts as a UI to the issues in this repository.   
* Our 3-week Heartbeat process is based on the one used by Webmaker, and they have a [great page explaining how we work](http://book.webmaker.org/heartbeats.html).
* To get involved you can add your name in the comments section of any issue, specifying the way you think you can help.  You can also ask questions this way.

If you have specific skills you would like to contribute (for example: QA/Coding/Writing) then please reach out to anyone on the team with more information.

Thanks for visiting!
